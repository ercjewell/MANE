# MANE
Music, Arts, and NFT Education 

*Statement of Broad Need*
LeMoyne Owen College’s Department of Fine Arts and Humanities strives to foster a student-centered learning environment with innovative teaching and learning initiatives that develop students’ communication and literacy skills, promote cultural awareness and knowledge, and enhance students’ artistic and musical abilities. Just as a new generation of learners and thinkers is emerging, so too are the technologies that are surrounding them in their everyday lives (LeMoyne-Owen College, 2021). Current university curriculums have been sufficient for previous generations, but innovation within teaching and learning styles is needed for universities to stay in alignment with new and emerging technologies to reflect the learning and teaching styles of their enrolled population (Schleichert, 2020). LeMoyne-Owen College, the only Historically Black College in Memphis, Tennessee, and Memphis Slimhouse Collaboratory are requesting $695,000 over three years for a Research and Emerging Technology for Teaching and Learning (RETTL) Grant; Music, Arts, and NFT Education (MANE). Four full-time enrolled sophomores at LeMoyne-Owen College pursuing a Fine Arts degree with a concentration in music or art; Fine Arts professors from LeMoyne-Owen College; and music and art educators from Memphis Slimhouse will participate in this inaugural program. All of whom will be pursuing a new avenue of exploratory technology integrated into teaching and learning for the future. MANE aligns with the purpose of RETTL to “fund exploratory research in emerging technologies for teaching and learning in the future” and their goal to “support transformative research on advanced technologies for teaching and learning to educate a new generation of students, teachers, educators, and mentors to excel in highly technological and collaborative environments of the future” (RETTL, 2021).
